                    <p>
                        By accessing or using the Service provided by Laser Leads Digital ("us", "we", or "our") at [Your Website URL], you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service. Please also review our <a href="privacy.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a>, which governs the collection and use of your information.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">2. Description of Service</h2>
                    <p>
                        Laser Leads Digital provides a platform that allows registered users ("Members") to earn rewards, such as points, cash value, or gift cards ("Rewards"), by watching video advertisements and potentially engaging in other promotional activities offered through the Service. The availability of ads and the value of Rewards may vary.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">3. User Accounts</h2>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">3.1. Registration</h3>
                    <p>
                        To use the earning features of the Service, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to consent to processing personal data) to create an account.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">3.2. Account Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Each individual is permitted only one account. Creating multiple accounts is strictly prohibited.
                    </p>
                     <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">3.3. Account Termination</h3>
                     <p>
                        We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms or fraudulent activity. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service or contact us. Upon termination, your right to use the Service and any accumulated, unredeemed Rewards will immediately cease.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">4. Earning Rewards</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rewards are earned by successfully completing required actions, primarily watching video advertisements to completion as indicated by the Service. The amount of Reward for each action will be specified within the Service. Laser Leads Digital reserves the right to change Reward values, add, or remove earning opportunities at any time without notice. Rewards have no cash value until they are successfully redeemed according to the Payouts section below and are non-transferable. Accurate tracking of viewed ads and earned Rewards depends on factors including stable internet connection and browser settings (e.g., accepting cookies). We are not responsible for Rewards not credited due to technical issues beyond our reasonable control.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">5. Payouts</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once you have accumulated the minimum required amount of Rewards ("Minimum Payout Threshold"), you may request a payout through the available methods listed on the Service (e.g., PayPal, gift cards). Payout methods and Minimum Payout Thresholds are subject to change. You are responsible for providing accurate payment information. We are not liable for payments sent to incorrect accounts due to user error. Payout requests are typically processed within 48-72 business hours but may take longer. We reserve the right to delay or cancel any payout for purposes of preventing unlawful activity or fraud, risk assessment, security, or investigation. You are responsible for any taxes associated with receiving payouts. Potential fees associated with specific payout methods (e.g., PayPal fees) may be deducted from the payout amount, as indicated during the redemption process.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 border-b pb-2">6. User Conduct and Prohibited Activities</h2>
